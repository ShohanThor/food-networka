					<h3>About Me</h3>
					<p>
						Many years' experience and the same wish to experiment and innovate as when, at 13, she was “initiated” into cuisine.
						She then attended a hotel-management school with passion and worked her way in various famous restaurants. Thus started her adventure into the world that taught her high cuisine and that she learnt to revolutionise with her creations and dishes.
						A faultless resume crowned by the opening of Dolce Stil Novo’s in 1990, that was followed by many acknoledgments.
						Today, after a series of international experiences and attendance at various events, Tarin is the manager of a restaurant located in one of the most magnificent Royal Palaces, the Palace of Venaria.
